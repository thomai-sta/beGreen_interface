# beGreen_interface

Prototype interface for a recycling system implemented for the course "Database Systems" of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. It is a point-awarding system designed to motivate citizens to recycle more, by measuring the amount of recycling that the users do and offering gifts.

The infrastructure assumes a number of recycling kiosks installed at different areas of the city of Thessaloniki, Greece. At these kiosks, citizens can recycle different materials and register their gained points. In the scope of the course, a database had to be developed, representing all necessary components of this system (registered users, employees, kiosks, materials, companies offering gifts, recycling trucks and factories etc.).

Additionally, a prototype interface of the system was designed as well. The interface offered different modalities to different users (simple user, employee, employer etc.). A number of screenshots showing the basic functionalities of the interface are offered, alongside the code.

This project was carried out by Thomai Stathopoulou and Katerina Iliakopoulou
